## ideas for further development

-add webpage preview to overview and details, to add some visual interest
-add filter and order options and a search bar on the overview
-add filter and order options and the seller name in the detail view
-as default have the chocolates order by price on the details view
-have a match between name and brand instead of just name to identify identical chocolates, better yet would be to have an unique identifier like a Barcode number.
-convert price to euros in case it is in a different currency to be able to compare and calculate mean values
-add a last seen section
-add a favorites section
-add a rating system
-add pagination
